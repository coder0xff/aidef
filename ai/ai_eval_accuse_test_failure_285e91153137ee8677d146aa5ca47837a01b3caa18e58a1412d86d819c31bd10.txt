The test `test_lorum_ipsum_with_small_number_of_words` failed due to an issue within the `function_implementation` of `lorum_ipsum`. The expected behavior, based on the test description, was for the `lorum_ipsum` function to return a string "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" when input with `words=5`. However, the test failure message indicates that the actual output was "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet," which differs from the expected output in two critical aspects: the capitalization of the first word and the trailing comma included in the output.

The first issue stems from the expectation that the output start with a lowercase 'l' ("lorem"), whereas the actual function implementation does not perform any case conversions on the output text, leading to the first word being capitalized ("Lorem") as it is in the original lorem ipsum text. The second discrepancy is the presence of a trailing comma after "amet," which indicates that the function does not account for punctuation being considered as separate from the word count. The original lorem ipsum text includes punctuation marks directly succeeding some words without spaces, which the simplistic split operation used in the function does not exclude, hence counting "amet," as a valid word.

Neither the `test_implementation` nor the `test_description` explicitly accounts for or clarifies expectations regarding text capitalization or punctuation handling. The assumptions specified do not address whether the output should match the case sensitivity of the standard lorem ipsum text or how punctuation should be treated in relation to word counts. Therefore, the discrepancy leading to the test failure can be attributed to an oversight in the `function_implementation` concerning the handling of text capitalization and punctuation when determining the output.

Given these considerations, the conclusion is that the failure of the test case primarily arises from a misalignment between the expected output format (lowercase and without trailing punctuation) and the actual output generated by `lorum_ipsum` (which retains the original text's capitalization and includes punctuation as part of the word count). To resolve this discrepancy, the `function_implementation` needs revision to correctly handle case sensitivity and punctuation in relation to word counts.
