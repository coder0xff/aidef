The test failure arises from an incorrect expectation within the "test_implementation" regarding the output of the "lorum_ipsum" function. Specifically, the test expects that the return value for a call with `words=1` would be 'lorem'. However, the actual return from the function implementation at the start of the lorem ipsum generator is 'Lorem', with a capital 'L'. This discrepancy highlights an incorrect assumption in the "test_implementation" about the casing of the first word returned by the function. The "function_implementation" correctly generates lorem ipsum text, starting with a capital 'L', as would be expected from proper noun formatting in written text. Moreover, the documentation within the "function_implementation" and its ability to return a string with the specified number of words adheres to the postconditions. The test failure, therefore, results from the test case's incorrect expectation regarding the case sensitivity of the returned string's first character.

Additionally, the "test_description" compounding this error assumes the returned string adheres to a specific format ('lorem') rather than accepting the correct formatting inherent to lorem ipsum text ('Lorem'). This misunderstanding of the expected output format points to a flaw in the "test_implementation"â€”specifically, its lack of accommodation for the standard formatting of the lorem ipsum text as returned by the "function_implementation". 

Given these considerations, the flaw that led to the test failure resides not in the "function_implementation", which behaves as specified by adhering to the preconditions and postconditions, but in the "test_implementation". The test's failure to account for the capitalized first letter of the lorem ipsum text, a standard convention, indicates that the error stems from an incorrect expectation and an erroneous test case description.
