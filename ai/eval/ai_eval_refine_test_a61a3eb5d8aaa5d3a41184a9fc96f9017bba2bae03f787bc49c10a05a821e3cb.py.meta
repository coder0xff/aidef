The first word \"Lorem\" in the lorem ipsum text generated by the function is capitalized, as it should be since \"Lorem ipsum\" traditionally starts with a capital \"L.\" Conversely, the test expected the output to be in lowercase (\"lorem\"), which misaligns with the actual behavior and output of the function implementation.\n\nThis oversight suggests that the test implementation did not accurately consider the capitalization inherent in the lorem ipsum text as produced by the `lorum_ipsum` function. Given that the function\u2019s correct behavior (including its output's capitalization) is implicitly supported by its docstring and the behavior of producing traditional lorem ipsum text, it is clear that the failure lies not with the function itself but with the test's expectations.\n\nThe function implementation adheres to the described signature and preconditions, generating lorem ipsum text of the specified word count and including a docstring, thus fulfilling the postconditions.\n\nTherefore, the error does not lie in the function implementation but in the test implementation's oversight regarding capitalization of the output. The test expected a lowercase \"lorem\" without considering that the lorem ipsum text traditionally begins with a capitalized \"Lorem.\"\n\nCULPRIT: test_implementation\""]}
