The function_implementation is designed correctly and adheres to the specified preconditions and postconditions. It calculates the gamma function for a given float (x) and returns a float value as expected. The presence of a docstring and the correct utilization of the math.gamma function indicate that the function_implementation meets the prescribed requirements.\n\nThe failure emerges from the test_implementation, specifically from the mismatch between the \"expected_output\" and the actual output from the function. The test_implementation anticipates a placeholder string \"Expected output for gamma_function(100.0)\" as the expected outcome, rather than calculating or obtaining the actual expected value based on the gamma function's definition and behavior. As a result, when the gamma_function is executed with an input of 100.0, it returns a scientifically accurate result (9.332621544394415e+155), which indeed is the correct behavior expected from such a function when handling large float inputs.\n\nThe test_description itself might lead to confusion or incorrect assumptions since it suggests testing with a large float to check if the function can handle large inputs correctly, but it does not specify a concrete expectation regarding the function's output. Without a correct and specific expected value to compare against, the test cannot accurately assess the functionality and correctness of the gamma_function. \n\nSince the function_implementation behaves as expected by calculating the gamma function correctly, the issue lies within the test_implementation's approach to validating the correctness of the function's output. The use of an undefined \"expected_output\" for comparison instead of a scientifically calculated or otherwise correctly obtained expected value for gamma_function(100.0) is an incorrect approach in the test_implementation.\n\nCULPRIT: test_implementation\""]}
