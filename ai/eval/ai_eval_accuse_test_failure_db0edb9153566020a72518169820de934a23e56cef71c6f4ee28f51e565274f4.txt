The failure of the test case "test_lorum_ipsum_with_small_number_of_words" can be attributed to an expectation issue within the test implementation rather than a problem with the function itself.

The core issue lies in the comparison of the expected and actual outputs within the test implementation. The test failure message indicates a discrepancy in capitalization and punctuation: the expected output did not account for the initial capitalization of "Lorem" and the absence of a comma at the end of "amet" in the actual output. This hints at an incorrect assumption in the test implementation regarding the standard format of lorem ipsum text. Specifically, the test expected the function to return "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", while the correct output, according to the lorem ipsum text provided in the function implementation, starts with a capitalized "Lorem" and does not include a comma at the end of "amet".

Furthermore, the function implementation correctly adheres to the postcondition requiring it to return lorem ipsum text with a word count exactly matching the input. It also includes a docstring, satisfying another postcondition. The issue does not lie in the function implementation but rather in the test's expectations, which did not consider the format nuances of lorem ipsum text as returned by the function.

Given the erroneous assumption about the expected text format in the test implementation and the function's correct adherence to the described postconditions and preconditions, the issue causing the test failure is within the test implementation itself.
