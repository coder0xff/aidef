The test failed due to a discrepancy in the expected output versus the actual output from the `lorum_ipsum` function. The expected output in the test `test_lorum_ipsum_with_small_number_of_words` does not match the initial capitalization and punctuation present in the `lorum_ipsum` function's output. Specifically, the function `lorum_ipsum` capitalizes the first word "Lorem" as it's defined in the hardcoded lorem ipsum text. However, the test expected the output to start with a lowercase "lorem". Additionally, the test expected no trailing comma, but the function's output includes punctuation as part of the word count, leading to a mismatch when comparing strings directly. 

The `function_implementation` correctly implements the requirement that the return value is a lorem ipsum with a word-count of "words", adhering to the postconditions. The failure arises in the `test_implementation` due to an overly strict expectation that does not account for the first word's capitalization and the inclusion of punctuation within the word count, which are traits of standard lorem ipsum text. These aspects were not explicitly outlined in the postconditions or preconditions, suggesting that the test's expectations were not fully aligned with the natural output of generating lorem ipsum text. 

Furthermore, the `function_implementation` adheres to the postcondition that it must have a docstring, which is present and accurate regarding its functionality. The failure thus does not lie in the `function_implementation` but instead in the mismatch of expectations outlined in the `test_implementation`.

Given the evidence, the issue resides in the `test_implementation` due to incorrect assumptions about the formatting and content of the output string. Specifically, the expectation of lowercase start without accounting for typical lorem ipsum formatting (i.e., standard capitalization and punctuation as part of word counts) indicates a misalignment with the natural behavior of the `lorum_ipsum` function.
