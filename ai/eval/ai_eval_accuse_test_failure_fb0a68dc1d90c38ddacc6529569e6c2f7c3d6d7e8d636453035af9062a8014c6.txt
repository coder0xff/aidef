The test failure, as indicated by the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs for the gamma function evaluation at x = -3.5, warrants a thorough examination of both the test and function implementations to identify the reason for the discrepancy and suggest improvements.

1. **Analysis of `function_implementation`:** the implementation of the gamma function appears correct at first glance, effectively using Python’s `math.gamma` to compute the function's value for a given float input. It aligns with the preconditions and postconditions by accepting a float and not allowing non-positive integers as input, returning a float, and including a docstring. To improve, it’s crucial to ensure `math.gamma` is accurately used, especially with edge cases or near the boundaries defined by the preconditions. Verifying accuracy against external mathematical software or literature especially for uncommon inputs, can further ensure reliability.

2. **Analysis of `test_implementation`:** The core issue in the test implementation lies in the "expected output" being a placeholder rather than a calculated or externally validated value. This problem is not just a matter of an incorrect expected result but indicates a need for a more rigorous approach in defining what is expected. For test robustness, employing a cross-verification method where the expected values are derived from an independent, reliable source would ensure higher accuracy. Additionally, extending the test range to cover more scenarios, including edge values and different types of valid float inputs within the domain, would robustly verify the function’s correctness.

3. **Potential Issues and Recommendations:** While assuming function and environmental correctness, it's still beneficial to consider potential variability in `math.gamma` output due to different Python versions or environments. Ensuring consistent test environments or specifying environment requirements for the tests could mitigate such issues.

Future test implementations could incorporate parameterized testing to efficiently cover a broad spectrum of inputs, including but not limited to, positive floats, negative floats (non-integers), and values near the non-positive integers to thoroughly verify the function's compliance with its preconditions and postconditions.

Moreover, adding checks within the test to validate the function's behavior with invalid inputs (e.g., non-positive integers or non-float types) would strengthen the test suite by ensuring adherence to all preconditions.

Finally, considering the integration of a dynamic validation mechanism that calculates expected outcomes using a secondary method or source for cross-validation purposes would not only increase the test's reliability but also its adaptability to potential function modifications in the future.

The above examinations and recommendations underscore the importance of refining the test approach by employing a rigorous, accurate method for determining expected outputs, broadening the scope of test cases, and considering environmental consistency to effectively validate the function implementation and ensure robustness against a wide range of inputs.
